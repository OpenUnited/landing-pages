            OpenUnited offers a powerful platform for optimizing digital product development by intelligently matching demand with supply through AI-powered processes. Our target enterprises typically have 250 or more employees, with at least 50 engineers involved in product development. While C-level executives, especially CFOs, are likely to see the platform as a solution to inefficiency, middle management may perceive it as a threat to their control or team structures.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
            To address these dynamics, our adoption strategy is flexible, allowing enterprises to engage with OpenUnited in ways that best suit their current needs and challenges. This includes introducing the platform through events like buildathons or fixathons, incentivized competitions, or cross-team collaboration overlays. Each entry point provides a way to minimize the perceived threat while demonstrating value, with the potential to scale up into a more integrated operating model over time.
